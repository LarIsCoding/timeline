This is my submission to Swift Student Challenge 2022 (Accepted)

This playground should be run on an iPad.

All its illustrations are also made by me, including the background, characters and other visual elements.

The background music is from Uppbeat (free for Creators!) and can be found in the next link:

The sound effects used in buttons and actions were downloaded in Epidemic Sound, a platform with royalty free sounds.

I hope you enjoy the playground!
